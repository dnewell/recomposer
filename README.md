# recomposer
The Axiomatic Text Recomposer transforms one or more text files as specified in a *.axioms file.  The axioms file contains a list of - you guessed it - axioms (aka replacement rules), which are serially processed by the program, allowing non-technical users to script complex, multi-line text transformations.
