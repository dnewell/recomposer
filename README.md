# The Axiomatic Text Recomposer
The Axiomatic Text Recomposer is a tool to perform transformations on one or more text files.  The transformations are specified by the user in an *.axioms file. Axioms are text replacement rules, serially processed by the Axiomatic Recomposer. They allow a non-technical user to script complex, multi-line text transformations.  The more technically inclined user may specify axioms as Python Regular Expressions, enabling automation of everything from a few find-and-replace operations, to the orchestration of extremely complex suites of text/data mutations.
